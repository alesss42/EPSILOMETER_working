I made a cron job on DEV1 to rsync files to DEV3. It still didn't work on it's own so I added a ssh command. In order to get the ssh to work without having to enter the password, I added the password to an .ssh keychain.

To add the  password to the MATLAB computer:
ssh-keygen -t rsa (just click enter to leave the file in the default location and have no password)
ls -lah .ssh  (to check that the file is there)
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh mod_admin@192.168.1.168 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

To make the cron job:
- make a file in /Users/Shared/FCTD_EPSI called copy_raw_to_DEV3 in vi. The contents are:
rsync -auq /Users/Shared/FCTD_EPSI/RAW/ mod_admin@192.168.1.168:/Users/Shared/EPSI_PROCESSING/RAW

To make the file excecutable
chmod a+x copy_raw_to_DEV3

To add to the crontab
crontab -e

Type the following and save with :w
* * * * * /Users/Shared/FCTD_EPSI/copy_raw_to_DEV3
(The asterisks say when and how often to run the file. All 5 asterisks mean run it every minute.)

To check that it's in the crontab
crontab -l

In theory, we should be able to set up an .ssh keychain on DEV3 and have it try to rsync within the Matlab script from DEV1. I set up the keychain password, but Matlab doesn't seem to like looking for files in mod_admin@192.168.1.158. I haven't figured out how to solve this.
